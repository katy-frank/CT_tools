######################################## File Paths ########################################
INPUT_PATH: path to folder where all your inputs are stored 
UPLOAD_FOLDER: The name of the folder containing files to batch upload.
# The rest of your metadata should come from either a series of CT metadata files or a spreadsheet.
CT_METADATA_FOLDER: The name of the folder containing CT metadata files. 
# Don't forget to set CT_METADATA_FOLDER = None in this case.
CT_METADATA_FILE: If CT scan metadata is already in a spreadsheet, enter file name.
OTHER_METADATA_FILE: If have additional metadata in a separate spreadsheet (.csv or .xlsx), put that file name here
#Spreadsheet file options:
    # If you have a single spreadsheet with both CT metadata and other data,
    # then use only CT_METADATA_FILE and set OTHER_METADATA_FILE to None.
OUTPUT_FILE: Name of final output spreadsheet file, assuming same location as input (Note no file ending. Will write to .xlsx)

######################################## Fundamental setup choices ########################################
OVERT: Is this upload part of the oVert TCN grant? # determine oVert now, as will set downstream choices.
BATCH: Are there batch scans in the upload?
QUERY_IDIGBIO: Do you want to search the iDigBio database to fill in Collection and Occurrence ID?

######################################## File name parsing ########################################
#User needs to set how a file name will be parsed into a specimen
    #In oVert, the recommended file naming convention is:
    #MUSEUM-COLLLECTION-NUMBER_notes, where MUSEUM = museum code, COLLECTION = collections code,
    #NUMBER = specimen number, and notes might be "head" or "skull" for close-up
    #or a genus name, or some other note. Notes are optional. 
#Set how a name will be broken into pieces. Default is space, dash, or underscore
    #Note that dash and underscore both need a backslash in front of them (ex: '\_')
DELIMITER = '[\-]' 

# After a name is broken up by the delimiter, set which segment corresponds to which part.
# The count begins at 0, so indicate the first segment with 0, the second segment with 1, etc.
# Input -1 if there isn't any
SEGMENT_MUSEUM = 0
SEGMENT_COLLECTION = None
SEGMENT_NUMBER = 1
SEGMENT_BODYPART = None

######################################## oVert-specific settings ########################################
# Choose either number corresponding to institute or 'None'.
GRANT_SCANNING_INSTITUTION = 5
GRANT_SPECIMEN_PROVIDER = None

######################################## Media Permissions ########################################
PROVIDER = Name of the copyright holder. Also used as the entity granting permission.

#### Copyright Permission Options:
# Choose either number corresponding to institute or 'None'.
COPY_PERMISSION = 2

#### Media Policy Options: oVert prefers 5, but check with your institution
MEDIA_POLICY = 5

#### Publication status: oVert prefers 2, but check with your institution

######################################## CT metadata ########################################
#### Are the CT metadata still in a series of raw CT output files, or are they already in the input spreadsheet?
#CT_METADATA_SPREADSHEET = False

#Add additional CT settings that aren't always in raw output files:
TECHNICIAN: Write the name of the scanning technician in quotes

WEDGE = Write what wedge was use in scanning, if any, in quotes.

#If you include shading, flux, or geometric calibrations, respectively, change to True.
CALIBRATION_SHADE = True
CALIBRATION_FLUX = False
CALIBRATION_GEOMETRIC = False

#Write any description of scanner calibrations, if wanted, in quotes.
CALIBRATION_DESCRIPTION = None

#If CT_METADATA_SPREADSHEET = True, then you need to map the column names below. Refer to ctscan_sample1.csv for an example of how each default maps.
NAME_SCAN = 'scan_trip' #name of the scan. Might equal a specimen name or batch designation
NAME_VOXELX = 'X_voxel_size_mm' #voxel size
NAME_VOXELY = 'Y_voxel_size_mm' #voxel size
NAME_VOXELZ = 'Z_voxel_size_mm' #voxel size

NAME_FILTER = 'filter' #filter

#### For each in filter: if 'Unknown', set to None
######################################## Spreadsheet mapping ########################################
# This section is one you will need if OTHER_METADATA_FILE = True and you want to map variables that were not included in the CT metadata section.
# Refer to input_sample1.csv for an example of how each default maps.
NAME_SPECIMENS = 'catalog_number'

NAME_GENUS = None
NAME_SPECIES = None
########################################################################################################################
# If you batch scanned, then you must have a spreadsheet in INPUT_DF.
    # Why? Because you need a key to match specimens to the batches they are a part of
    # Make sure you mapped NAME_SPECIMENS above, too. 
#this is the column name containing the name of which batch a specimen is in.
NAME_BATCH = 'scan_metadata'

######################################## If not oVert, you need to set these variables, too ########################################
#Enter any grant funding as a string
FUNDING_SOURCE: this is the column name containing element information
NAME_ELEMENT: this is the column name containing which side of the body an element comes from
# Note: when populating this column, text options are:
NAME_SIDE: Not Applicable [use for 'whole body'], Unknown, Left, Right, Midline
NAME_FILE: The column name containing the file names to be uploaded.

######################################## Mesh settings ########################################
MESH_SUFFIX = Do your meshes have suffixes? (ex: 'UF-M-12345_mesh.stl' or 'UF_M_12345_cropped.stl')?
